# CSCE315_HCI# csce315-HCI-Privio

A Cybersecurity Awareness Application that can evaluate the user’s security score and display the user’s sensitive information to help increase awareness and protect privacy. Over 12 APIs were used (I implemented 6 of them) to retrieve sensitive information from popular sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more. No authentication is required since Privio only collects publicly available information
